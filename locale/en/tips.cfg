steam-engine=the earliest way to make electricity via combustion with [entity=boiler]. \n[entity=steam-engine] \nStats: \n    output maximum: 7.3MW \n    consumes: [fluid=steam] \n    amount: 15 per second \n    maximum temperature: 500°C \n\n\n[entity=boiler] can only generate steam at a maximum temperature of 250 °C.\nIn order to use the full potential of the steam engine, [entity=geothermal-plant-mk01] can be placed on [entity=geothermal-crack].\nThe [entity=geothermal-plant-mk01] generates [fluid=geothermal-water] at high enough temperatures to max out the [entity=steam-engine].

steam-turbine=[entity=steam-turbine] → Max. power output 119 MW. ([item=py-science-pack-2] )\n\nUnlocked with [technology=uranium-processing], the [entity=steam-turbine] is a side-grade to the pressurized steam turbines intended to allow the usage of the heat generated by the [entity=nuclear-reactor]. It consumes 60 [fluid=steam] per second at a maximum temperature of 2000 °C.

hp-steam-turbines=[entity=steam-turbine-mk01] → Max. power output: 473 MW ([item=py-science-pack-1] )\n[entity=steam-turbine-mk02] → Max. power output: 9.5 GW ([item=py-science-pack-2] )\n[entity=steam-turbine-mk03] → Max. power output: 143  GW ([item=py-science-pack-3] )\n[entity=steam-turbine-mk04] → Max. power output: 2.4 TW ([item=py-science-pack-4] )\n\nThe high-pressure steam turbines consume large amounts of [fluid=pressured-steam] and generate huge amounts of energy.\n[fluid=pressured-steam] must be generated inside [entity=py-heat-exchanger], [entity=py-heat-exchanger-mk02], [entity=py-heat-exchanger-mk03], [entity=py-heat-exchanger-mk04].\nEach tier of heat exchanger produces [fluid=pressured-steam] at progressively higher temperatures ranging from 1000 °C - 5000 °C.\n\nHeat exchangers transfer their heat into [fluid=pressured-water] and the heat is sourced from [fluid=hot-molten-salt]. Many non-renewable power plants can create [fluid=hot-molten-salt] including [entity=py-coal-powerplant-mk01], [entity=py-biomass-powerplant-mk01], [entity=py-gas-powerplant-mk01], [entity=py-oil-powerplant-mk01], and [entity=nuclear-reactor-mk01]. It's important to choose the correct powerplant based on technological level and available resources.\n\nEach turbine consumes 60, 600, 6000, and 60000 [fluid=pressured-steam] per second respectively.

wind=Wind turbines are a clean and safe way to generate energy for your factory. There are three different varieties of wind turbine. Horizontal axis wind turbines such as [entity=hawt-turbine-mk01], vertical axis wind turbines such as [entity=vawt-turbine-mk01], and multiblade turbines such as [entity=multiblade-turbine-mk01].\n\nAll wind turbines have a variance based on current wind speeds. This number represents the maximum or minimum energy output of the turbine. For example a 10mW turbine with a variance of 80% will have a maximum power output of 18mW and a minimum power output of 2mW. The formula for turbine variance is (sin(2t) + sin(πt)) / 2 where t is the current gametick divided by 10000.\n\nAll wind turbines also have an airspace. Placing a wind turbine within another turbine's airspace will cause interference and is not allowed.\n\nHAWT turbines are manufactured with expensive parts, but benefit more from productivity modules. They have the lowest variance and the highest power output.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk01] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 5MW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk02] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 25MW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk03] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 50MW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk04] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 80MW, Airspace: 9 tiles.\n\nVAWT turbines are less expensive than HAWT turbines. They have a medium power output and a medium variance.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk01] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 4MW, Airspace: 16 tiles.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk02] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 20MW, Airspace: 14 tiles.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk03] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 50MW, Airspace: 14 tiles.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk04] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 85MW, Airspace: 15 tiles.\n\nMultiblade turbines require the fewest materials to manufacture however they have a low power output and a very high variance.\n[entity=multiblade-turbine-mk01] → Variance: 90%, Average Output: 550kW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=multiblade-turbine-mk03] → Variance: 80%, Average Output: 34MW, Airspace: 8 tiles.

blimp=The [entity=aerial-blimp-mk01] generates energy by flying high in the atmosphere. Aerial turbines have a huge battery size and the lowest energy export priority making them perfect for dealing with power spikes or brownouts.\n\nAerial turbines must be placed in a power grid. They will then take a random walk between all the power poles in the grid. [entity=power-switch] can be used to limit the possible paths that aerial turbines can take.\n\nLonger trips allow the turbine to maintain high RPM increasing effectiveness (up to a max bonus of +100%).\n100 tiles → +25% bonus\n1000 tiles → +51% bonus\n10000 tiles → +76% bonus\n100000 tiles → +91% bonus\n1000000 tiles → +97% bonus\nThe exact formula for calculating distance bonus is 2-(1 / (distance^0.5/30+1) )\n\nIf your network does not have enough power poles, you may get a "This airspace is too crowded!" error. Each aerial turbine requires 3 power poles.\n\n                       Tier                             Speed             Output        Avg. Output     Battery  \n [entity=aerial-blimp-mk01]   1.2 tiles/s   4.5  MJ/tile   6.25 MW       400 MJ   \n  [entity=aerial-blimp-mk02]   2.4 tiles/s   9.0  MJ/tile   25.0 MW       800 MJ   \n  [entity=aerial-blimp-mk03]   3.6 tiles/s   13.5 MJ/tile   56.3 MW       1.6 GJ   \n  [entity=aerial-blimp-mk04]   4.8 tiles/s   18.0 MJ/tile   100  MW       3.2 GJ\n\nUnlocked at [technology=renewable-mk02], the [entity=aerial-base-combinator] can automatically deploy or remove aerial turbines from an electric network. Perfect for upgrading aerial turbine networks to higher tiers or constantly topping up your power network. Feed the [entity=aerial-base-combinator] with the aerial turbine circuit signals and it will attempt to keep that exact number of turbines deployed in a network. Note that missing signals are counted as 0. Consumes 1MW.\nOutputs [virtual-signal=signal-1][virtual-signal=signal-2][virtual-signal=signal-3][virtual-signal=signal-4] based on the current number of aerial turbines in the electric network per tier.\nOutputs [virtual-signal=signal-A][virtual-signal=signal-B][virtual-signal=signal-C][virtual-signal=signal-D] based on the current number of aerial turbines stored in the base (max: 10) per tier. \nOutputs [virtual-signal=signal-yellow] based on the summed stored energy for every turbine (MJ).\nOutputs [virtual-signal=signal-green] based on the summed maximum capacity of all turbines (MJ).

lfr-stirling=[entity=lrf-panel-mk01] and [entity=stirling-concentrator] both use sunlight to warm up [fluid=molten-salt] during the day. The higher-temperature molten salt can then be used to generate electricity via [entity=lrf-building-mk01] and [entity=solar-concentrator]. Adding more panels or concentrators will increase the speed at which the salt is warmed, and therefore the speed at which the power plant will be able to operate. The [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] adds 600kW of heat to the molten salt stored inside of it, and the [entity=stirling-concentrator] does the same at 1.6MW of heat. Note that it can take a while for the salt to warm up initially.\n\nThe temperature of the molten salt does not automatically equalize between entities. Instead you must continuously pump the cold salt into the hot salt. The other panels contribute to the heating of the salt that goes into the power plant, even though it may take a while for the system to reach a steady state.\n\nBoth the [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] and the [entity=stirling-concentrator] are disabled during night time however they will have 100% output even with a small amount of daylight. There is no falloff. The ratio between [entity=lrf-building-mk01] and [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] is 46.2 panels per power plant. The ratio between [entity=stirling-concentrator] and [entity=solar-concentrator] is 34.2 panels per power plant.

thermosolar=[entity=sut] is a solar tower megastructure that works by using the sun to heat hot air through a large number of [item=sut-panel] tile covers. Hot air rises through the tower and spins generators. In order to generate energy, the [item=sut-panel] must be placed in a 100 tile radius of the main [entity=sut]. Each tile generates 320 kW and a maximum of 31488 can be placed around a single tower.\nThe solar tower is most effective during high noon. Without full daylight, the output of the tower is smoothly reduced. Other power generation or storage methods will need to be used in the downtime. With the full amount of [item=sut-panel] the tower will output 10.1 GW during peak daytime. On average a full tower will generate 7.1 GW.\nUnlike other tiles, the [item=sut-panel] is placed above machines instead of on the ground. This means that you can build anything underneath the glass surface while still functioning as-expected.\nNOTE: Due to the minor amounts of processing power needed to simulate the [entity=sut] it is likely the most UPS-efficient power source in Pyanodon’s mods. This is a great option if you are struggling for performance.\n\nUnlocked at [item=py-science-pack-4] with [technology=thermal-mk03].\n\n[entity=solar-tower-building] uses solar energy to heat [fluid=hot-molten-salt]. [entity=solar-tower-panel0] is used to orient and focus all solar light to a single point. Each [entity=solar-tower-panel0] must be placed in a 100 tile radius of the megastructure and generates on average 59.8 MW. The maximum number of [entity=solar-tower-panel0] around a single solar tower is 1926.\nDuring noon, the [entity=solar-tower-building] generates up to 115.2GW and converts 4000 [fluid=molten-salt] into 4000 [fluid=hot-molten-salt] per second at 5000° C. This is enough energy to continuously run 1/50th of a [entity=steam-turbine-mk04]. On average throughout the whole day a full [entity=solar-tower-building] generates 80.64 GW.\n\nUnlocked at [item=utility-science-pack] with [technology=thermal-mk04].

microwave-receiver=[entity=microwave-receiver] allows the transfer of solar energy from [item=microwave-satellite] in orbit.\n\nEach [item=microwave-satellite] can beam down up to 4.8MW of energy. In order to get the satellite into orbit, launch it into space with a [entity=rocket-silo]. The [entity=rocket-silo] has room for up to 5 satellites per launch.\n\n[entity=microwave-receiver] can support up to 15 satellites for a total of 72 MW.

nuclear-fission=Starting with [technology=uranium-processing] convert [item=uranium-ore] into [item=pu-238] needed for [item=chemical-science-pack] using the [entity=nuclear-reactor]. the reactor will burn fuel cell regradless of the heat being used or not. \n\nAfter researching [technology=nuclear-power] you can produce large amounts of electricity with [entity=nuclear-reactor-mk01] fueled by [fluid=uf6] or with [entity=nuclear-reactor-mox-mk01] fueled by [fluid=puo2].\n\nThe reactors will produce reactor waste [fluid=reactor-waste-1] or [fluid=reactor-waste-2]. the reactor waste can be separated into [fluid=hot-molten-salt] and [item=high-energy-waste-1] or [item=high-energy-waste-2] which can be processed to recover unburnt uranium and plutonium isotopes for science and fuel.\n\nThe [entity=nuclear-reactor-mk01] is used to produce power and convert [item=yellow-cake] into [item=plutonium-oxide] more effectively than would be done in [entity=nuclear-reactor].\n\nThe [entity=nuclear-reactor-mox-mk01] produces power and converts excess [item=u-238] and [item=pu-239] into other isotpoes of plutonium.\n\nThe fuel processing for one [entity=nuclear-reactor-mk01] will be able to produce the [item=u-238] required by several [entity=nuclear-reactor-mox-mk01]. the recycled waste of both can produce more than the needed [item=pu-239] to feed the [fluid=puo2] for the [entity=nuclear-reactor-mox-mk01].\n\nSee the section on [item=steam-turbine-mk01] on power production with [fluid=hot-molten-salt]

mdh=The [entity=mdh] is the most powerful compact fusion generator theoretically possible. It uses pure [fluid=neutron] plasma as a moving conductor, rotating at impossible speeds. Just a single MHD generator is powerful enough to supply all but the most massive factories.\nIt's unlocked at [item=production-science-pack] with [technology=fusion-mk02] and generates up to 1.5 TW.\n\nThere are 5 ways to manufacture the required [fluid=neutron] plasma:\n\n[recipe=thermal-neutron]:\nUse a [entity=neutron-moderator-mk01] to heat subzero neutrons to 500 °C. This method consumes expensive [item=control-rod] but can be used in a pinch without access to proper fusion reactors. Due to inadequate plasma ionization, the MHD generator will operate at 10% efficiency and generate 150 GW.\n\n[recipe=dt-fusion]:\nTritium fusion is the first neutron plasma manufacturing process inside the [entity=fusion-reactor-mk01]. Unlocked at [technology=fusion-mk02], this power source consumes valuable [fluid=tritium] which can only be made from [recipe=deuterium-fusion] inside a 2nd [entity=fusion-reactor-mk01]. The plasma ionization is 4X more efficient than compared to [entity=neutron-moderator-mk01] and can generate 600 GW inside [entity=mdh]. Note that each [entity=fusion-reactor-mk01] consumes 5.17 GW which cannot be reduced with [item=efficiency-module-3].\n\n[recipe=dt-he3]:\n[technology=fusion-mk03] unlocks aneutronic [fluid=helium3] fusion. Aneutronic fusion can only be performed inside the [entity=fusion-reactor-mk02] which consumes a massive 41.33 GW. This recipe consumes expensive [item=silver-foam] and [fluid=liquid-helium] to create up to 900 GW in the MHD generator.\n\n[recipe=b-h]:\nBoron-hydrogen fusion is a sidegrade fusion method unlocked at [technology=fusion-mk04]. It consumes the [fluid=tholins] inside [item=production-science-pack] and creates up to 1.2 TW in the MHD generator.\n\n[recipe=antimatter-fusion]:\nAntimatter fusion is the final and most powerful form of fusion unlocked at [technology=fusion-mk04]. A steady supply of [item=antimatter] can effectively generate infinite energy. It creates a perfectly ionized neutron stream for the MHD generator to run at 100% efficiency and generate 1.5 TW.
