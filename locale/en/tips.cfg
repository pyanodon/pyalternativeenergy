wind=Wind turbines are a clean and safe way to generate energy for your factory. There are three different varieties of wind turbine. Horizontal axis wind turbines such as [entity=hawt-turbine-mk01], vertical axis wind turbines such as [entity=vawt-turbine-mk01], and multiblade turbines such as [entity=multiblade-turbine-mk01].\n\nAll wind turbines have a variance based on current wind speeds. This number represents the maximum or minimum energy output of the turbine. For example a 10mW turbine with a variance of 80% will have a maximum power output of 18mW and a minimum power output of 2mW. The formula for turbine variance is (sin(2t) + sin(πt)) / 2 where t is the current gametick divided by 10000.\n\nAll wind turbines also have an airspace. Placing a wind turbine within another turbine's airspace will cause interference and is not allowed.\n\nHAWT turbines are manufactured with expensive parts, but benefit more from productivity modules. They have the lowest variance and the highest power output.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk01] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 5MW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk02] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 25MW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk03] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 50MW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk04] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 80MW, Airspace: 9 tiles.\n\nVAWT turbines are less expensive than HAWT turbines. They have a medium power output and a medium variance.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk01] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 4MW, Airspace: 16 tiles.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk02] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 20MW, Airspace: 14 tiles.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk03] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 50MW, Airspace: 14 tiles.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk04] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 85MW, Airspace: 15 tiles.\n\nMultiblade turbines require the fewest materials to manufacture however they have a low power output and a very high variance.\n[entity=multiblade-turbine-mk01] → Variance: 90%, Average Output: 550kW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=multiblade-turbine-mk03] → Variance: 80%, Average Output: 34MW, Airspace: 8 tiles.
blimp=The [entity=aerial-blimp-mk01] generates energy by flying high in the atmosphere. Aerial turbines have a huge battery size and the lowest energy export priority making them perfect for dealing with power spikes or brownouts.\n\nAerial turbines must be placed in a power grid. They will then take a random walk between all the power poles in the grid. [entity=power-switch] can be used to limit the possible paths that aerial turbines can take.\n\nLonger trips allow the turbine to maintain high RPM increasing effectiveness (up to a max bonus of +100%).\n100 tiles → +25% bonus\n1000 tiles → +51% bonus\n10000 tiles → +76% bonus\n100000 tiles → +91% bonus\n1000000 tiles → +97% bonus\nThe exact formula for calculating distance bonus is 2-(1 / (distance^0.5/30+1) )\n\nIf your network does not have enough power poles, you may get a "This airspace is too crowded!" error. Each aerial turbine requires 3 power poles.\n\n                       Tier                             Speed             Output        Avg. Output     Battery  \n [entity=aerial-blimp-mk01]   1.2 tiles/s   4.5  MJ/tile   6.25 MW       200 MJ   \n  [entity=aerial-blimp-mk02]   2.4 tiles/s   9.0  MJ/tile   25.0 MW       400 MJ   \n  [entity=aerial-blimp-mk03]   3.6 tiles/s   13.5 MJ/tile   56.3 MW       800 MJ   \n  [entity=aerial-blimp-mk04]   4.8 tiles/s   18.0 MJ/tile   100  MW       1.6 GJ\n\nUnlocked at [technology=renewable-mk02], the [entity=aerial-base-combinator] can automatically deploy or remove aerial turbines from an electric network. Perfect for upgrading aerial turbine networks to higher tiers or constantly topping up your power network. Feed the [entity=aerial-base-combinator] with the aerial turbine circuit signals and it will attempt to keep that exact number of turbines deployed in a network. Note that missing signals are counted as 0. Consumes 1MW.\nOutputs [virtual-signal=signal-1][virtual-signal=signal-2][virtual-signal=signal-3][virtual-signal=signal-4] based on the current number of aerial turbines in the electric network per tier.\nOutputs [virtual-signal=signal-A][virtual-signal=signal-B][virtual-signal=signal-C][virtual-signal=signal-D] based on the current number of aerial turbines stored in the base (max: 10) per tier. \nOutputs [virtual-signal=signal-yellow] based on the summed stored energy for every turbine (MJ).\nOutputs [virtual-signal=signal-green] based on the summed maximum capacity of all turbines (MJ).
lfr-stirling=[entity=lrf-panel-mk01] and [entity=stirling-concentrator] both use sunlight to warm up [fluid=molten-salt] during the day. The higher-temperature molten salt can then be used to generate electricity via [entity=lrf-building-mk01] and [entity=solar-concentrator]. Adding more panels or concentrators will increase the speed at which the salt is warmed, and therefore the speed at which the power plant will be able to operate. The [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] adds 600kW of heat to the molten salt stored inside of it, and the [entity=stirling-concentrator] does the same at 1.6MW of heat. Note that it can take a while for the salt to warm up initially.\n\nThe temperature of the molten salt does not automatically equalize between entities. Instead you must continuously pump the cold salt into the hot salt. The other panels contribute to the heating of the salt that goes into the power plant, even though it may take a while for the system to reach a steady state.\n\nBoth the [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] and the [entity=stirling-concentrator] are disabled during night time however they will have 100% output even with a small amount of daylight. There is no falloff. The ratio between [entity=lrf-building-mk01] and [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] is 46.2 panels per power plant. The ratio between [entity=stirling-concentrator] and [entity=solar-concentrator] is 34.2 panels per power plant.
microwave-receiver=[entity=microwave-receiver] allows the transfer of solar energy from [item=microwave-satellite] in orbit.\n\nEach [item=microwave-satellite] can beam down up to 4.8MW of energy. In order to get the satellite into orbit, launch it into space with a [entity=rocket-silo]. The [entity=rocket-silo] has room for up to 4 satellites per launch.\n\n[entity=microwave-receiver] can support up to 15 satellites for a total of 72MW.
